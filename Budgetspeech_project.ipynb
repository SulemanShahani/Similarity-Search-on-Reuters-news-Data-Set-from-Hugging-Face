The representatives of all federating units are represent ed in this Government , therefore , the decisions taken for countrys economy enjoy the greater backing of entire nation. 2. The Government is facing the difficult challenge of deteriorated economic conditions due to extremely poor performance during the last quarter to four yea rs. Last Government has been taking revenge from Pakistan and its people continuously for quarter to four years for un known reasons. Social structure was badly affected because of their short  sightedness. Economic growth has stopped and national unity was disintegrated. Poor governance had peaked during their era due to which common man was affected badly. Rupee experienced massive devaluation, consequently price of everything skyrocketed. The li fe of poor and middle class beca me miserable. BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 2 3. A naïve team had pushed the country toward s disaster during the last quarter to four years. Every year, a different person used to present budget and every year rather during the year economic policies of the government would change due to which confid ence of inve stors and development partners was shaken. Those people were master in refuting what they had said earlier. The people of Pakistan had seen their U turns at every stage but as they were habitual, they continue d to vary their stances before international fraternity and international financial institutions . This led to suspension of IMF programme in February, 2022 which was scheduled to complete in the same year. The fundamental reforms which were due to take place in 2019 were not initiated. 4. Fundamental reforms are required to correct the structural imbalances of economy. Such reforms usually face immediate public backlash but the dividend is that the foundation s of economy are set on solid foundation. Previous government was reluctant to t ake such reforms. Thus they have been pending all such reforms due to which the economy could not stand on its feet so far , therefore, prosperity remained elusive . 5. The incumb ent government has short time. The government could have easily passed on the buck to next Government to the detriment of BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 3 country. In anticipation, we have decided to carry out all those reforms which will benefit to the economy and hence the country. The joining of this government was conscious decision in the backdrop of a deterio rating economy . We had two options one was to leave the country in the situation in which it was and announce new elections but that would have ruined the economy and put ting, again the country back on the track would have been difficult. Therefore, we c hose the second option and started taking difficult decisions. The succession of taking difficult decisions is still incomplete. Indeed, this is a difficult way but this is the only path to wards sustainable progress. We have done it before, we can do it and we will do it. In shaAllah. 6. We always preferred national interest against our political interest. This time o ur first and foremost priority is economic sta bility. A fundamental problem of our economy has been that the rate of economic growth remain ed 34 percent which is inconsistent with the growth rate of our population. I n contras t to it, when the growth rate exceed ed 5  6 percent, it led to uncontrollable current account deficit. The reason behind this phenomena is that to advance the economy we have been giving concession to affluent classes. This used to result in increase in imports while exports remain ed stagnant. This happen last year , rather the same BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 4 happened every time. Therefore, we have to adopt new thinking and we will have to find a solution as a nation. To run economy forward incentive s have to be given to our middle and poor classes which will result in increasing domestic production, in turn leading to improvement of agriculture. 7. We will have to improve the economic situation of the poor and assist them so that their income is increased. When the income of the poor increase s, they buy goods and services which are produced domestically. Expenditure s on such consume r goods do not result in increas ing imports but the development process gets initiated in a country. By doing so, we can achieve sustainable and inclusive growth . 8. We will have to lay the foundation for economic growth. A sound foundation upon which a splendid edifice of sustainable growth can be constructed and which stay s there with all its glory. We will have to focus on increas ing exports as our growth formula. We will have to increase our Agricultur al, IT and Industrial export s. We will have to increase the produce of our agriculture and will have to increase the competitiveness of our exports so that it can compete with the products of other countries in international market. We will have to enhance the ease of doing BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 5 business to attract local and foreign investors. After importing machinery and raw material we will have to work for their value addition thereafter . In this way our volume of export will exceed than that of our imports . Economic Situation and Planning Mr. Speaker! 9. Every one knows that we are facing the challenge of putting a wrecked economy back on track. There has been economic in stability during the quarter to four years. Historically high prices, foreign exchange problems, reckless borrowing on high rate s, load shedding coupled with last governments failure s to mitigate these problems have made the lives of people very difficult and miserable. Mr. Speaker! 10. Owing to the bad govern ance during last quarter to four years, Pakistan stood third amongst sizeable countries in high prices . Seventy five million people are forced to live a poor life. The number increased by 20 million during the quarter to four years. During th at period six million people lost their jobs. P revious government borrowed Rs 20,000 billion during its tenure of quarter to four years which is equal to 80 of the total BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 6 debt taken since the times of Liaqat Ali, Khawaja Nazim uDin, Ayub Khan, Z ulfiqar Ali Bhutto, Mohtarma Benazir Bh utto, Main Muhammad Nawaz Sharif till Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and , Mr. Speaker including you during the last 71 years. It was because they spent phenomenally more than their income and presented the four highest ever deficit laden budgets in the history of Pa kistan. Their average budget deficit remained almost 8 .6. During this period our debt increased by almost Rs 5 ,000 billion annually and during current financial ye ar it is expected to reach Rs 54,000 billion. Likewise the circular debt of power which we l eft at Rs 1,062 billion in May 2018 has reached Rs 2500 billion . Circular debt in gas sector for the first time in the history of country has risen to Rs 1 ,400 billion now. 11. During the tenure of my leader Main Muhammad Nawaz Sharif , rise in prices had been very modest . The price hike remained close to 5 percent. The lowest level of inflation i.e. 3.9 was recorded during that period. Owing to the poor governance of last quarter to four years , there has been a persistent price hike in Pakistan . The former Prime Minister used to say that he had not come into power to monitor the prices of onions and tomatoes, rather he had come into power to make the country BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 7 great. I do not know how one can make the country great by grinding the common man into price hike. 12. I fail to understand as to why the prices of sugar and flour ha d gone up with the beginning of Imran Khans Government . In 2013, sugar was being sold at the rate of Rs 55 per k.g and in 2018 when we left the rate was Rs 53 per k. g. After 2018 sugar price sky rocketed , and exceeded Rs 140 per k.g. Then Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif came into power and brought it back to the level of Rs 70 per k.g. Likewise when we left in 2018 flour price was Rs 35 per k.g which in Naya Pakistan reached Rs 80 per k.g. But again, Shehbaz Sharif came into power who managed to supply flour at Rs 40 per k.g. at Utility Stores and a t a number of other specifi ed stores. At the end of our tenure Pakistan was exporting sugar and flour but at the end of t heirs we are compelled to import three million ton wheat this year . 13. The prices of energy also played its role in price hiking during the tenure of last government . We ha d solved the power crisis to a large extent. The responsibility of deepening energy crises once again lies with wrong polic y decisions of PTI Government during the last quarter to four years . They leveled concocted allegations against very competitive LNG BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 8 contract entered into by us, due to which man y respectable leaders had to face jails We could have tolerated, had they managed economical LNG contracts . But in stead of striking long term agreements at lowest rates that were available at that time due to Covid, they opted for costlier spot purchase s. This is the reason we are compelled to buy LNG at high rates at the moment to meet our immediate needs. Despite all this , we were blamed and many honourable leaders , including m yself, were sent behind bars, our sisters and daughters were dragged into it and they are still facing cases in courts. 14. Towards the end of February, when Imran Khan led government sensed that they will have to leave then, they tried to create hurdles in the way of coalition government , but in fact these were landmin es for th e economy of Pakistan. The prices of petrol and diesel were reduced despite the fact that government was running on borrowed money. Because of that destructive act our country was caught in a grave economic situation. The rescue efforts are still going on. 15. Keeping in view the high petroleum prices, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has decided to bail out the low income class es. Under his directives, it has been decided to pay Rs 2000 per month as assistance to BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 9 families having monthly income less than Rs 40 ,000 per month . The decision has been implemented w.e.f. June, 2022 and the additional assistance is being provided to existing beneficiaries of BISP automatically. Now 60 million more people will be added to it who will be paid Rs. 2,000 per month . This financial assistance has been included in fiscal year 2022 23 budget. It is not necessary to own a car or motorcycle, people who travel in buses can also benefit from it. 16. From 2013 to 2018 Pakistani currency remained stable but then due to miss governance of highest order the value of Pakistani Rupee fell by 61 percent and US dollar went from Rs 115 to Rs 189 between 2018 and 2022. D ue to aftershocks of this economic mismanagement , it crossed the level of Rs 200 by now. But we have taken all necessary steps to stabilize our currency and we will hope that In shaAllah it will become stable . Budget Vision and Economic Priorities Mr. Speaker! 17. Before going into the details of Budget , I would like to say something about the strategies and priorities of our government. BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 10 18. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif believes that maximum relief should be given to the people during these har d times especially to those poo r people who cannot withstand the storm of price hike. Government has taken many steps for providing assistance and subsidies in this respect but in order to continue it we will have to provide resources. For the purpose there can be a special tax on higher income earning s to redirect the wealth to wards poor people , so tax can be imposed on such income or on articles which are used mostly by affluent people and are used less by middle class or poor people. In this way higher income people will have to face a nominal burden . Thus the rich can provide much relief t o the poor. Mr. Speaker! 19. The budget philosophy of our government is to increase agricultural produ ctivity so that not only cultivated land increases but per acre yield also increases. Especially cultivation of edible oil producing crops like ma ize, sunflower and canola be increased so that agricultural imports can be decreased as well as current expenditure deficit. On the other hand , we will develop industries which products can be exported. In BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 11 this way we will have valuable foreign exchange and it will help to correct the balance of external payments on durable basis. Mr. Speaker! 20. It is imperative to improve the management of revenue s being collected currently along with exploring the avenues for new sources. If the theft of revenues is curbed which has increased during last quarter to four years, we can increase revenue collection substantially. According to an estimate tax theft has amounted to around three trillion rupees. Prime Minister is constituting a Task Force which will take measures to minimize this tax leakage. Moreover, we are making efforts to increase non tax revenues. Austerity Measures Mr. Speaker! 21. Austerity is our first priority when it comes to expenditures. Austerity in government expenditures is part and parcel of this budget . We are going to take concrete steps in this regard , we are not offering lip service . There will be a compl ete ban on purchase of vehicles. T here will be a ban on purchas e of furniture except for development projects. Petrol BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 12 limit for government employees officers and Cabinet will be curtailed by 40 percent. There will be ban on foreign visits at Government expense except mandatory foreign visit s. Mr. Speaker! 22. There is an allocation of Rs 530 billion in budget for next financial year like several other countries, we are going to establish Pension Fund, for which funds have been allocated. We are contributing ten billion rupees in the Pension Fund being the first year of its constitution . Macro economic Framework 23. According to the vision of Prime Minister , our team has devised a medium term macro economic framework to put the economy on track of growth. I firmly believe that the direction of our economy will be set right under his vision. 24. A gigantic challenge before us is to achieve growth without current account deficit. Next year at least 5 percent growth will be achieved without a balance of payment problem . Durin g the next year , GDP will be increased from Rs 67 trillion to Rs 78.3 trillion. BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 13 25. Inflation  At present the inflation stands at 11.7 which is the highest during the last 10 years. Government fully understands the reality that poor people are facing too many hardships. We are trying to lower prices by leveraging monetary and fiscal policy in a better way . Inflation will brought down to 11.5 percent during the next financial year. FBR Taxes 26. In emerging market countries , tax to GDP ratio is around 16 percent but in Pakistan it is 8. 6 percent at the moment. We plan to raise this ratio to 9.2 percent of GDP during next financial year. In 2017 18, we left this ratio at 11.1 percent. 27. Gross D eficit  Gross deficit that stand s at 8.6 percent of GDP during the current fiscal year will be decreased gradually. In the next fiscal year, it will be decreased to 4.9 percent. Likewise, overall primary balance that is currently 2.4 percent of GDP , will be improved to 0.19 percent during the next fiscal year. 28. Trade deficit  Our Government is taking concrete steps to increase exports and arrest the growth in imports so that trade balance can be improved and price of dollar is corrected automatically. The imports which are expected US76 billion upto this year, will be BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 14 decreased to the level of US 70 billion during the next fiscal year. Our exports are US 31.3 billion currently, s teps will be taken to increase export s to US 35 billion during next fiscal year . With these steps , current account balance of 4.1 percent of GDP will be decreased to 2.2 percent during next fiscal year. 29. Remittances  During current fiscal year foreign remittances are expected at US31.1 billion. It is estimated that remittances will increase to US 33.2 billion during the next fiscal year. 30. National Debt Servicing  This year total interest payment expenditure will be Rs 3,144 billion. Out of which domestic interest payment is estimated Rs 2,770 billion and external interest payment is estimated at Rs 373 billion. In the next financial year, payments under this head is estimated to reach Rs 3,950 billion out of which Rs 3,439 billion will be domestic and Rs 511 billion will be foreign debt servicing. 31. Public Debt Public dept in 2017 18 was Rs 25,000  billion. In March 2022 it rose to Rs 44,365 billion i.e. 72 .5 of GDP. We decreased the pace of borrowing by controlling expenditures in the last two months of the current financial year. Under the law Governments borrowing limit is fixed 60 of the GDP. BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 15 32. Under certain amendments in FRDLA, 2005, experts will be provided to Debt Management Office of Ministry of Finance. For efficient functioning, its mandate and powers are being enhanced so that management of debt can be founded on sound basis. At this moment I want to inform the house briefly that previous government while re  profiling debt, had planned to pay Rs 5 ,400 billion in 2029 in one go . Imagine, can the domestic money market arrange the entire amount in one go? Never ! We are managing this huge payment by efficient fragmentation of this huge amount so that government and domestic market can honour it. Budget Allocations Mr. Speaker! 33. Before giving you the salient features of budgetary allocations, I would like to present an overview of total revenue and expenditure s.

In addition, six billion rupees have been allocated for poor and the needy under Pakistan BaitulMal. Power Mr. Speak er! 40. Energy is a key to people, trade and industry. During first three months of our government , we have paid additional Rs 214 billion as subsidies to people to lessen the outstanding arrears left by previous government. An amount of Rs 570 billion is allocated under this head for next financial year so that common people are able to afford expenses on power, during this harsh summer. 41. We have released Rs 248 billion for the payment of petroleum sector outstanding arrears and have provided Rs 71 billion for next financial year. Soon we will announce new gas rates, under which gas will be supplied to industries on such rates competitive with other regional countries , so that exports will increase . Education Mr. Speaker! BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 19 42. Despite several financial constraints, and the fact that higher education is a devolved subject, we have allocated Rs 65 billion for Higher Education Commission HEC in current budget. Additionally, there is an allocation of Rs 44 billi on for development schemes of HEC under PSDP, which is 67 higher tha n the previous financial year. This is a proof of our commitment to our youth. I am particularly pleased to mention that with this funding we are going to establish a University in North Waziristan this year. We are persuading provinces that they should assume more responsibility for higher education in the coming years . 43. HEC budget comprises of 5,000 scholarships for Baluchistan and merged districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. There is a special scheme for coastal regions of Baluchistan . One hundred thousand laptops will be given to students on easy installment all over the country. To upgrade the engineering and technology education funds have been provided for state of the art equipment . Agriculture and Food Security Mr. Speaker! BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 20 44. Agriculture is the backbone of our countrys economy. Along with other measures, w e have allocated Rs 21 billion to increase crop yield and uplift of livestock sector . Ministry of Food S ecurity and Planning Commission, in consultation with provinces, have devis ed a three year growth strategy. The objective s of this strategy are to enhance production , increase farmers income , counter the negat ive effects of climate chan ges, promote smart agriculture, self sufficiency , value addition and agro processing. It is pertinent to mention here that the condition of port clearance will be abolished to facilitate the Sindh and Baluchistans small scale fishermen. Incentives for Youth Mr. Speaker! 45. Youth are an important asset of our country. A national youth commission will be established. There are various schemes for youth. An integrated syst em will be introduced to increase the role of educated youth in countrys development. Under Youth Employment Policy, two million youngsters access to employment opportunities will be ensured. Young men and women will be provided interest fr ee loan upto Rs 5,00,000. A loan scheme on low interest rate upto Rs BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 21 25,000,000 will be introduced. There will be 25 quota for women in loan schemes.

For encouraging the youth talent and entrepreneurship, In novation League will be established. Talent Hunt and Sports Drive Programme shall be devised for youngsters aged 11 25 years. Industry and Trade Mr. Speaker! 47. Industry is very important for every country. Products made in factory are not only exported but they meet the domestic demand too and provide livelihood for millions of people . Keeping in view its BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 22 importance, Ministry of Industries and Production, with the cooperation of Asian D evelopment Bank, has started work on Industrial Policy. 48. For the last three years , payment of DLTL claim arrears has been very slow. Prime Minister has directed to pay all the refund claims to export ers in the instant month immediately . At present verified claims by State Bank of Pakistan worth Rs 40.5 billion are outstanding. We are paying this amount immediately. It is to mention that a sales tax was imposed three months ago on pharmaceutical industries. Not only this but the ironical situation is that refund s were also not being issued to them. We shall release refund immediately . Likewise, despite financial difficulties, sales tax refunds are also being paid immediately. To provide uninterrupted power supply to industries, industrial feeders wi ll be exempted from load shedding. Investment  49. In order to promote investment in country, a new strategy is being chalked out under which an investor friendly environment will be provided and cumbersome procedure s will be abolished. Our government is planning reforms in Dispute Resolution Mechanism for BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 23 citizens and foreign investors. It will be ensured that the dispute resolution mechanism is economical, simple and effective. 50. International best practices will be adopted for the purpose which will include the alternate dispute resolution mechanism. These reforms will be introduced in consultation with superior judiciary so that it could immediately be implemented. 51. Previous Government did not establish even a single new speci al economic zone. Under CPEC, a lot of work on infrastructure had been completed till 2018 and now there is a need to use this infrastructure for economy. It was agreed with the Chinese Government that nine special economic zones would be established on CP EC route, investors from China and other countries will be facilitated to set up factories on these economic zones. H owever, previous government created many hurdles to slow down this work . By now, despite lapse of considerable time, not a single special economic zone could be made operational. 52. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has directed to make special economic zones at Rashkai in Khyber Pakhtunkhawa, Lahore in BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 24 Punjab and Dhabe Ji in Sindh to be made operational as soon as possi ble by immediately providing them electricity and gas. Promotion of Culture and Film Industry 53. Promotion of tourism, social diversity, for introducing culture and identity of Pakistan at international level the development of film, culture, heritag e and fine arts is inevitable. In 2018, first film and culture policy was approved by Cabinet during our tenure. Unfortunately, no progress was made during the last four years. In the spirit of said policy of 2018, film has been declare d industry . With an amount of Rupees one billion, Binding Film Finance Fund has been established and Medical Insurance Policy has been launched . 54. Five years tax holiday for film producers , and on establishing new Cinema houses, production houses, film museums is being announced and tax rebate is being given on export of film s and drama s for ten years, as well as producer s income and income from cinemas is being exempted from Income Tax. National Film Institute and Post Film Production Facility, and Natio nal Film Studio are being established with an allocation of Rupees one billion. BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 25 55. Eight percent withholding tax on distributors and producers is being withdrawn. The import of machinery, equipment used for production of films, drams and other items used for the purpose shall be exempt from Custom Duty for five years. Public Sector Development Programme PSDP Mr. Speaker! 56. An amount of Rs 800 billion has been allocated for Federal Public Sector Development Program . In 2017 18 we left Federa l Development Budget at Rs 1 ,000 billion. This time when we have taken up the Government again , it has been slashed to almost a half. 57. Federal government should build such infrastructure with its funds that can benefit the whole country to the full capacity . These people stopped the work on Gawadar Port because of their negligence and irresponsible attitude. Gawadar, which is deepest water sea port in the region, at present it is filled with sand and mud. 58. PTI government has also harmed my Quaid Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif s vision of laying and constructing Motorways in the country and intentionally kept motorway routs from BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 26 Chinese Boarder to Karachi and Gawadar incomplete at many points so that the mechanism of progress which was initiated by our Government may not bring prosperity to Pakistan . Similarly, they created hurdles in fulfilling Mian Muhammad Nawaz Sharif s dream of constructing MLI on modern lines connecting the whole Pakistan. They even did not start work ing on this project which could modernize Pakistan . During his tenure of quarter to four years Imran Khan just talked but did nothing practically . In this way after having wasted nations valuable times , he flew back to Bani Galla in Helicopter. 59. Now I am going to present priorities of development programme i. We will focus on completion of ongoing projects so that funds spent on these projects may not go to waste. ii. Despite having the lowest population , comparatively the largest allocation is being spent on Bal ochistan s Development so that the province can be brought at par with other parts of the country. BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 27 iii. PSDP allocation for provinces and special areas Azad Kashmir and Gilgit Baltistan has been increased to Rs 136 billion. iv. Dams that serve as water reservoirs are our utmost priority. Additional funds have been allocated for timely completion of Mohmand Dam and Diamir Bhasha Dam under the directives of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif . v. Highway connecting both sea ports to China will be completed. vi. By expediting the completion of infrastructure projects and economic zones under CPEC , attention will be focused on economic growth and exports . On the instruction of Prime Shehbaz Sh arif, four knowledge parks are being established in all the four provinces for which funds will be provided by the Federal Government. Infrastructure 60. As we have done before , the development of infrastructure according to national needs is our first priority. A total of Rs 395 billion ha s been allocated for this purpose. BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 28 EnergyPowers 1. Enhancing generation, transmission and distribution of electricity is governments priority. An amount of Rs 73 billion has been provided to power sector out of which Rs 12 billion will be spen d on timely completion of Mohama nd Dam as the Pr ime Minister has announced . These water reservoirs will also be used for agriculture. Earlier completion of this project will benefit farmers. Mr. Speaker! PTI has been in power for the last quarter to four years but failed to reduce even one percent loss in terms of transmission and distribution of electricity but instead they ended up increasing the loss after we left when our tenure had ended . With the 73 billion allocation in PSDP for this sector, we will Insha Allah minimize these losses. Water Resources 2. Water resources sector is closely linked with power sector . An amount of Rs 100 billion is included in the budget for big mult  purpose dams especially Diamir Bhasha, Mohama nd Dam, Dasu Dam, Nai Gaj Dam and commend area projects. Small dams , culverts, in less developed di stricts are also given priority. Power BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 29 and water resources projects are interlinked for which a total of Rs 183 billion have been allocated. Transport and Communication 3. An amount of Rs 202 billion has been allocated for hig hways and sea ports. Communication facility not only benefit s industry and trade but also give s market access to farmers but tens of thousands of people will also get employment . It has been over distinction in the past that we started construction of moto rways , completed them and today millions of people travel through these motorways daily . We are also utilizing private sector investment along with public funds for construction of highway s. Construction of highway s through public private partnership will be encouraged. Social Sector Mr. Speaker 4. Pakistan is a signatory of SDGs and is striving to achieve targets of SDGs. People are directly provided with civic facilit ies under this programme. To make the lives of people easy and to serve the under privilege d people , a hefty amount of Rs 70 billion has been BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 30 allocated. In addition, Rs 40 billion have been allocated for various other schemes in social sector. Programme s for Education and Youth 5. Our government has given pri ority to the completion of ongoing projects. An allocation of Rs 51 billion in the budget for higher education project has been proposed . Health 6. An amount of Rs 24 billion has been allocated to provide better health services to people, control a nd eradicate viral diseases, provision of medical equipments, vaccination and enhancement of the capacity of health institutions . Climate Changes 7. We are not oblivious of importance of climate changes in a difficult time like this. An amount of Rs 10 billio n ha s been allocated to meet this challenge which includes plantation and other projects for improving natural environment. Science, Technology and IT BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 31 Mr. Speaker! 8. Government has allocated Rs 17 billion for imparting training in IT sector, providing youth with laptops, improving network and promotion of IT export s. Agriculture and Food Security 9.

An amount of Rs 5 billion has been allocated for export s based on value addition of technology, mineral and other industrial sectors . An amount of 20 billion has been allocated for K 4 project in Karachi. BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 32 PART II FBR Part I Mr. Speaker , 61. The guiding principles for this years taxation policy are 1 More emphasis on Direct Taxes namely Income Tax  Capital value Tax. 2 Taxing the unproductive assets 3 Taxing those who made exhorbitant profits windfall gain 4 Protect the productive assets and 5 Bring equity through the distribution of wealth by taxing the wealthy. 62. As everybody knows that Pakistans investment climate and taxation s tructure do not encourage entrepreneurship. Rather it discourages new businesses and encourages investment in real estate. This is a multi faceted menace. It is anti growth. BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 33 63. It causes an artificial increase in the prices of real estate taking housing facilities out of the reach of the middle classes. The money generated from this dead investment is a major source of inflation and social disharmony. We dont want to discourage the real estate sector but we want to steer this sector in a direction where it can become the engine of growth for cities. Our proposals aim at encouraging construction, and vertical growth, and discouraging speculative investment in open plots. 64. This Government intends to create a business friendly environment. It has been un fortunate that the major thrust of recovery of income tax has been through withholding taxes. Adding fuel to fire, the presumptive tax regime that is largely run through withholding taxes has transformed its character from direct to indirect tax. Thus with holding tax regime has become inflationary in its nature. Moreover, it not only creates distortion in the taxation structure but also reduces the ease of doing business. This government aims at correcting this. We aim at reducing withholding taxes, convert ing final taxes to minimize taxes, and minimum taxes to adjustable taxes. Mr. Speaker , 65. I now present proposals regarding income tax relief measures BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 34 i The tax rate on salaried individuals The basic threshold of taxable salary is proposed to be enha nced to 12 lac from the current 6 lac rupees for salaried individuals. This would pass tens of billions of rupees benefit to salaried people. This will generate a positive economic cycle whereby this money would get transferred to the businesses as the dis posable income of salaried people increases therefore ultimately, the government will benefit through the thriving of the business, the creation of more jobs, and tax revenues in the future. ii The tax rate for Business individuals and AOPs In the face of inflation, the basic threshold of exemption for business individuals and AOPs is proposed to be enhanced from 4 lac to 6 lac. iii Reduction in the tax rate on Bahbood Certificates Curren tly profit from investment in B ehbood savings certificates, pe nsioners benefit accounts, and Shuhada family welfare accounts is taxed at a maximum rate of 10. BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 35 In order to provide further relief to pensioners, it shall be taxed at a maximum rate of 5. iv Fixed Tax Regime for retailers A fixed tax regime for small retailers is being proposed wherein tax will be collected along with electricity bills along with simplified registration and reporting regime. The proposed tax will range from Rs.3000 to Rs.10,000 and this will be a final discharge of tax liability. I can reassure the business community that FBR will not probe further after payment of the fixed tax by a retailer. v Admissibility of 100 depreciation Industrial undertakings and other businesses are allowed to adjust 50 of depreciation charges in t he first year. This is causing additional burden and difficulty for industrial undertakings. I propose to allow adjustment of 100 depreciation. vi Admissibility of tax collected from industrial undertakings at the import stage BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 36 Mr. Speaker, Advance income tax on imports is collected under the Twelfth schedule on the classification of goods into plant  machinery, raw materials, and finished goods. Certain finished goods so categorized are used by industrial undertakings as raw material. They are not able to adjust this tax. It is causing a crunch in their working capital and this is an anomaly in the law. It is proposed that industrial undertakings be allowed to adjust tax deducted at the import stage on all materials. I now present proposals for an e quitable taxation structure with a propoor bias and encouraging investment in the productive sectors of the economy. Moreover, my proposals focus on taxing the rich and unproductive sectors. vii Tax on deemed rental income Mr. Speaker, The major part of the wealth of rich people is parked in the real estate sector in Pakistan. This is a double faceted menace. It leads to the accumulation of unproductive assets and raises the prices of housing BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 37 for the poor and lower income groups. We inte nd to correct this imbalance. Therefore, all persons who have more than one immovable property exceeding Rs.25 million situated in Pakistan shall be deemed to have received rent equal to 5 of the fair market value of the immovable property and shall pay t ax at the rate of 1 of the fair market value of the said property. However, one house of each individual will be excluded. viii Tax on transactions of immovable properties The current challenging times in Pakistan warrant huge sacrifices from the ric h and affluent. It is about time that the privileged and affluent sections of society must come forward to play their pivotal role in the socio economic development of Pakistan. We intend to provide a taxation structure where all classes of assets are taxe d in an equitable manner. Unfortunately, our present taxation regime provides incentives for unproductive investments and taxes heavily the productive sectors. In order to correct this, capital gain all classes of assets is now proposed to be taxed at 15 in case, the holding period of such property is one year or less. The capital gain BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 38 payable on such assets will reduce to zero after a ho lding period of 6 years, reducing tax liability by 2.5  with each subsequent year. Furthermore, the advance tax rate on the purchase and sale of property for filers is proposed to be enhanced to 2 from the current 1. Moreover, in order to discourage the undocumented economy, the advance tax rate for buyers of immovable property who are non filers is proposed to be enhanced to 5. ix Tax on High Earning Persons Mr. Speaker, Pakistan is passing through unprecedented economic conditions. It is a time that our rich should come forward and pay taxes. In order to shift the tax burden from poor to rich, all persons inclusive of companies and associations of persons, earning an annual income of Rs. 300 million or more, are proposed to pay 2tax. x Increase in advance tax on luxury vehicles In continuation of our policy to shift the burden of tax on the rich class, advance tax on motor vehicles exceeding 1600cc is proposed to be increased. Furthermore, advance tax shall also be BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 39 collected at the rat e of 2 of the value in cases of high value hybrid and electric vehicles. Additionally, the rate of tax for non  filers shall be enhanced to 200 from the current 100. xi Tax on windfall profits The banking sector has earned windfall gains due to higher interest rates and risk free investment in Government securities. In order to capture the real tax potential, the tax rate on banking companies is proposed to be enhanced to 45 from the current 39 inclusive of super tax. I now present proposals regarding streamlining and enhancing documentation of economy xii Criteria for becoming tax resident in Pakistan Criteria for the resident person for the purpose of taxation are being modified. The current regime is being misused by wealthy individual s whereby they are not tax residents of any country therefore it is proposed that any citizen of Pakistan who is not a tax resident of any other country shall be treated as a tax resident of Pakistan. BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 40 xiii Advance tax on international card payments Advance withholding tax at the rate of 1 for filers and 2 for non  filers shall be collected from persons remitting money outside Pakistan through credit, debit, and prepaid cards. However, this tax shall be adjustable against tax liability. Sales Tax  F ederal Excise Measures Mr. Speaker, 66. Coming to indirect taxes, Inland Revenue collection has shown a healthy growth in the overall tax collection of FBR. 67. Keeping in view the requirement of meeting the fiscal deficit, it is imperative that the government takes tough decisions for the overall benefit of the country and the government under the leadership of PM Mian Shahbaz Shareef has practically demonstrated that it has the capacity and will to take such decisions. Sales Tax is the backbone of revenue collection. But as per the vision of the PM, the present budgetary proposals aim to tax the sectors that have either remained out of the tax net or hovered in t he periphery and not paid taxes as per the actual capacity. BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 41 68. While the government wants to collect its due share of taxes by broadening the base and focusing on previously un attended sectors, in tandem with the vision of the PM, the government also wa nts to extend due relief in taxes, the effect of which will trickle down to common man. 69. Pakistan is suffering from acute shortage of energy. Thermal energy is expensive due to skyrocketing fuel prices. Renewable energy is the possible way forward. It is proposed to exempt import and local supply of solar panels from sales tax. Besides, consumers using fewer than 200 units of electricity will be facilitated in obtaining soft loans on easy terms from the banks for the purchase of solar panels. This will not only promote ecofriendly use of energy but also save precious foreign exchange spent on the import of fuel and gas. 70. In order to facilitate agriculture, it is proposed to withdraw sales tax on the supply of tractors, agricultural implements, and va rious seeds including wheat, rice, maize, sunflowers, canola, and rice. 71. Charitable hospitals are contributing substantially to providing health facilities. It is proposed to extend complete sales tax exemption on import donations to charitable hospita ls and local supplies including electricity to charitable non profit hospitals with 50 or more beds. BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 42 Mr. Speaker, 72. In order to facilitate taxpayers, some fundamental changes are being proposed in the Alternate Dispute Resolution mechanism through which a taxpayer whose tax liability is Rs.100 million or more, can benefit from the proposed mechanism. In this new mechanism, a taxpayer can nominate his own representative while the second representative will be the Officer of FBR. However, the third repres entative of ADRC will be nominated by mutual consultation of FBR and the taxpayer. Therefore, in this mechanism, two of the three members of ADRC will be nominated with the consent of the taxpayer. Not only the question of fact but also the question of law can be brought for resolution before the ADRC. The decision of ADRC will be made by the majority. Therefore, I invite all the eligible taxpayers to benefit from the proposed dispute resolution mechanism. At the same time, I also welcome the entire busines s community to withdraw their cases pending with various courts and joint ADRC to settle disputes through this new mechanism. This will not only lessen the burden on the courts but also contribute significantly to taxpayers facilitation. BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 43 FBR Part II Pakistan Customs Mr. Speaker 73. In this budget, the government is striving to strengthen agriculture. Various relief measures have been taken for farm mechanization and logistics. In order to give relief to the agricultural sector and farmers of the country, Customs duties exemption have been extended further on agricultural machinery pertaining to irrigation, drainage, harvestingpost  harvest handling and processing, greenhouse farming, and plant protection equipment as well as machinery, equipment, and other capital goods for miscellaneous agro based industries. 74. To provide a boost and further strengthen to the industrial economy, Customs Duty, Additional Customs Duty, and Regulatory Duty on around 400 tariff headings pertaining to different indus trial manufacturing sectors have been rationalized. Out of these, taxes are being decreased on 350 items. 75. The Regulatory DutyRD regime has been reviewed and Regulatory Duties on multiple items have been either reduced or removed. However, it is als o important to mention that in many cases BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 44 Regulatory Duty was imposed with the intention to protect the local industry. 76. The Textile sector being the backbone of the economy, merits special attention, therefore, the tariff structure has been rationaliz ed for synthetic filament yarn to meet the long standing demand of the sector. 77. Furthermore, in view of the sensitivity of the pharmaceutical sector, more than 30 Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients API have been exempted from customs duties. Furthermo re, raw materials of the first aid bandages manufacturing industry have also been exempted from customs duties so as to reduce the cost of local production of this important medical item. Besides, multiple exemptionsconcessions in tariffs have also been g iven to many other sectors . Mr. Speaker! Cigarette sector pays a lot of taxes. We have started to apply tax track and trace system in this sector. We have applied this system on three cigarette companies and intend to apply it this year on still more. We have increase d tax on them. We will increase tax collection from this sector from 150 billion to 200 billion this year. Mr. Speaker, 78. All the above budget proposals, indeed, aim at strengthening the national economy and also promoting a transparent, effective, and BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 45 equitable tax system that ensures taxpayers facilitation and ease of doing business in the country. PART III RELIEF MEASURES Mr. Speaker 79. Despite the fact that country is facing a severe fiscal crisis , we are aware of the hardships faced by government employees. P rice hike has affected the household expenditures badly , especially that of salaried class but in spite of the severe fiscal difficulties and lack of resources, salaries of government employees are being increased by 15 in order to improve their purchasing power. Moreover, it was the long lasting demand of the government employees to me rge the adhoc relief measures in their basic pay. This demand has also been accepted. Concluding Words Mr. Speaker! 80. Everyone knows that our economy is under severe pressures. But everyone knows that we always prefer red to serve the nation . The coalition government will eagerly sacrifice for coming out of this crisis. We promise that with public support and blessing of Allah we will stabilize the BUDGET SPEECH 2022 23 46 economy. In the end , I appeal the whole nation that considering the situation of our homeland, it is the responsibility of every c itizen to play hisher role in progress of our country. We will have to prove that we are a living nation. May Allah Almighty Protect and help us Long live Pakistan !\n"
